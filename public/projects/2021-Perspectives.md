The Project Perspectives is an interactive web art exhibit created in 2021. Visitors entering the site can experience different perspectives of characters in the scene, and the space takes on warmth based on who you are observing.

This project emerged as I delved into delivering a distinct experience of sculpture in digital format. It stands out as one of my favorite creations.

(It's available in VR as well)

The sculptures were crafted using ZBrush and Blender, while the coding aspect utilized THREE.js and GLSL.
