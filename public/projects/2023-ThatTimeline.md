[Timeline](https://choisohan.github.io/that-timeline/) is a straightforward quiz web application crafted in 2023 to aid in the comprehension of the chronological order of historical events. The concept originated from my desire to alleviate the stress associated with studying history. The game's rules and visual design draw significant inspiration from the board game [Wavelength](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength).

This application is built using NodeJs and React, with the historical database benefiting from ChatGPT's assistance. I manually researched individual events to enhance the accuracy and richness of the historical content.
