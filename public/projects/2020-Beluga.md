Beluga is one of early interactive animal project. I strategically opted for a whale because 90% of the animation involves the spine, making it simpler than limb animations.

Thanks for Computer Vision Technology, Webcam's 2D space human position could be converted into 3D space position.

Digial Beluga is looking at the human position and create a new animation per frame. All animation is procedually generated without key-framed animation.
